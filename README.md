## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airbnb-clone-api.git
cd airbnb-clone-api
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/airbnb_clone
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   STRIPE_API_KEY=your_stripe_api_key
   ```

4. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl. Ensure that you have proper authentication tokens for accessing protected endpoints.

## API Endpoints

For detailed documentation of API endpoints, refer to the [API documentation](./docs/api-docs.md).

## Authentication

Authentication is handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users can obtain a token by logging in or registering with the system. This token must be included in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests to access protected endpoints.
